# Changelog

Spindle has no release yet. Everything below is on `main` and unreleased.

## Unreleased

### Documentation

- A documentation site, built with Docusaurus under `website/` and published at
  <https://beyond10x.github.io/spindle/>: overview, getting started, concepts, the rally example,
  the CLI reference and the status page.
- `spindle-docs` generates the CLI reference from the clap definitions and the status page from a
  capability list whose shipped items each name the test that holds them; `task check` fails on
  drift.
- A logo.

### Added

- `b10x-spindle metrics`: the counters and histograms one component reports, derived from the
  specification (`spindle-telemetry`); `play` prints the table's non-zero counters under the grid.
- `b10x-spindle run --decisions <file>` and `--answer-default`: answer external outcomes without a
  per-line `external` object.
- List views with a `state ==` filter and `order_by`; minted `Uuid` identities through the derived
  `identity.mint` capability (bound to `uuid-v4` in both example environments).
- Host-side CPU and memory sampling per launched instance, and its share of the request.
- The `spindle.observe` domain with generated JSON Schema, Rust (`spindle-observe-api`) and
  TypeScript types, and the observe UI in `ui/` (Vue 3) built and tested on fixture answers.
- A specification directory is read through its `ess-inputs.yaml` when it has one. ESS moved to
  0.87.0.
- `b10x-spindle play`: the rally example's three components in one process, redrawn in the
  terminal after every tick until a side wins (`spindle-host`).
- `b10x-spindle run`: admit a specification, then execute commands read as JSON lines on stdin
  (`spindle-kernel`, with memory and SQLite stores).
- `spindle-timer`: periodic bindings on an injected clock, with the ESS periodic profile.
- `spindle-channel`: event bindings between components, in process or over TCP, with an outbox and
  at-least-once redelivery.
- `spindle-target`: the deployment target contract, placement within a target's ceiling, and the
  process launcher. `spindle.placement` in Spindle's own specification.
- `spindle-qemu` and `spindle-firecracker`: microVM launchers without root, as libraries; their
  tests run on a host with KVM (`task check:vm`).
- The rally example specification, `examples/rally/ess`.
- `b10x-spindle check`, `capabilities` and `admit`: load and compile a specification with
  `ess-compiler`, derive its capabilities, and admit it against a `spindle-environment/1`
  document (exit 3 when refused).

### Changed

- The `b10x-spindle` command-line definitions moved to `spindle_cli::cli` so the documentation
  generator reads the same clap definitions the binary parses. The commands are unchanged.
